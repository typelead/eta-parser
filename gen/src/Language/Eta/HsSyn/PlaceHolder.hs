Note [Pass sensitive types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since the same AST types are re-used through parsing,renaming and type
checking there are naturally some places in the AST that do not have
any meaningful value prior to the pass they are assigned a value.

Historically these have been filled in with place holder values of the form

  panic "error message"

This has meant the AST is difficult to traverse using standed generic
programming techniques. The problem is addressed by introducing
pass-specific data types, implemented as a pair of open type families,
one for PostTc and one for PostRn. These are then explicitly populated
with a PlaceHolder value when they do not yet have meaning.

Since the required bootstrap compiler at this stage does not have
closed type families, an open type family had to be used, which
unfortunately forces the requirement for UndecidableInstances.

In terms of actual usage, we have the following

  PostTc id Kind
  PostTc id Type

  PostRn id Fixity
  PostRn id NameSet

TcId and Var are synonyms for Id
